# Survival
A simple game with single and multiplayer options using JavaFX

The multiplayer networking uses some source code given to me by my APCS teacher, Mr. Shelby; the same code is made available to all APCS students in his classes for their final progjects.
I adapted the code to create the multiplayer part of the game.

# General Rules
- Red squares damage your ball.
- Green squares heal your ball.
- Yellow squares grant temporary invincibility.
- Red, green, and yellow squares all move randomly.
- Maroon squares are tracker bosses, which follow your ball when not invincible, and run away when your ball is.
- Purple squares are shooter bosses, which move randomly but shoot "spray shots" of bullets.
- Two enemies are generally enough to kill your ball, and bosses one shot.
- Score is increased for the size of each enemy that spawn, and for each enemy killed (either by absorbing its damage or by killing it when invincible).
- In the multiplayer version, you can also damage the opponent by running into them (which will damage them more than yourself).
